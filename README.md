- 👋 Hi! I’m Kapil (pronunciation : `cup ill`) and I am a Security Engineer by profession. 
- 😜 I am also a recovering Network Engineer and an Openstack survivor. 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software and automation tools for security operations (blue team or red team)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django and container security. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting projects that can be used to automate or improve security operations.
